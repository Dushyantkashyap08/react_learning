//React: a lightweight javascript UI library for building user interfaces
//component based / modular code
//resuse, easy to understand and maintain clean code
//while working with actual DOM in react, a virtual DOM is also created by react which is the copy of acutal DOM

//SPA (single page aplications):  dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server

//Reduced server load (only data is exchanged, not entire pages).
